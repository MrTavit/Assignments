# Code Refactor

This task was an experiment in cleaning up some code for a website without changing the functionality. 

Some element tags were changed for added clarity of sections within the site.

The homepage was given an appropriate title. 

Alt attributes were added to all images for accessibility.

The phrases on the right hand side of the navbar are clickable links, these will bring the window down to the section corresponding to the clicked phrase.
